                        (A Python Web Framework)

- What is it?
PWF is a super minimalistic framework speaking WSGI. It's intended for
building simple APIs or quick prototyping. It's for taking care of the 
very basics and leaving the rest up to you.

PWF was made to build simple web APIs focusing on returning
and recieving JSON. It does not and will not feature any server
side templating, blueprints, session management etc. 

JSON, text, headers, cookies and response codes. Simple as that. 

- What is it not?
It's not a full featured framework. It's not Django or Flask or Bottle.
It's not for running in large scale production websites. Batteries are
not included.

- Is it production ready?
Nope.

- What are some more serious frameworks?
Have a look at Flask, Django, Bottle, Falcon, Web2py or Web.py
