                        (A Python Web Framework)


- What is it?
PWF is a super minimalistic framework speaking WSGI. It's intended for
building simple APIs or quick prototyping. It's for the people who want
to be able to look at and understand all the code in 30 minutes. It's
for taking care of the very basics and leaving the rest up to you. It's
for complete flexibility in whatever way you like.

PWF was made to build lightweight REST APIs focusing on returning
and recieving JSON. It does not and will not feature any server
side templating, blueprints, session management or similar. 

JSON, text, headers, cookies and response codes. Simple as that. 


- What is it not?
It's not a full featured framework. It's not Django or Flask or Bottle.
It's not for running in large scale production websites. Batteries are pruchased, 
or rather manufactured separately. It will not catch you safely.


- What are some more fully featured frameworks?
Have a look at Flask, Django, Bottle, Falcon, Web2py or Web.py
